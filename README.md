FamilySearch Link
=================

Quickly jump to any FamilySearch person, direct from your Safari toolbar.

**[Click here to install](https://github.com/bjhomer/FamilySearch-Link/releases/download/v1.0/FamilySearch-Link.safariextz)**

![FamilySearch Link in action](docs/screenshot.png)

Type an ID, hit Enter, and a new tab will open to that person's detail page.

Hit Option-Enter instead, and you'll go to their tree page.

It's a simple as that.
