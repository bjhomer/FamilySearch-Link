FamilySearch Link
=================

Quickly jump to any [FamilySearch][1] person, direct from your Safari toolbar. **[Click here to download][2]**

![FamilySearch Link in action](docs/screenshot.png)

Type an ID, hit Enter, and a new tab will open to that person's detail page.

Hit Option-Enter instead, and you'll go to their tree page.

It's a simple as that.
